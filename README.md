First, it's my course work. This code has written in short period of time without any desire (only part with c++).
I used this source for reference point:
- [front_end and some part of back](https://github.com/iamakkkhil/eShare)

My changes just make it quicker than was: adding Postgres and micro_services. Project not finish and needs more changes and in my part of code (use more optimal solution).

## Setup:

1.  Clone the repository(of course).
2.  For first running:
    
        ./scripts/run_app.sh -f
    
    In scripts you can find some flags

3. If you want clean all staff from this project:

        ./scripts/clear_all_staff.sh -a

    In scripts you can find some flags
